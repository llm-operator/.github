# LLM Operatror

LLM Operator transform your GPU clusters into a powerhouse for generative AI workloads.

## Key Values

- *Provide LLM as a service.* LLM Operator builds a software stack that provides LLM as a service, including inference, fine-tuning, model management, and training data management.
- *Utilize GPU optimally.* LLM Operator provides auto-scaling of inference-workloads, efficient scheduling of fine-tuning batch jobs, GPU sharing, etc.

## Use Cases

- Develop LLM applications with the API that is compatible with [OpenAI-compatible API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference).
- Fine-tune models while keeping data safely and securely in your on-premise datacenter.
- Run fine-tuning jobs efficiently with guaranteed SLO and without interference with inference requests.
